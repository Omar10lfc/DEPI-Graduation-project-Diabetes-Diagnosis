# DEPI-Graduation-project-Diabetes-Diagnosis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing diabetes using a comprehensive dataset of health and demographic information. The notebook contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial steps towards building a predictive model.

## Dataset
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/100000-diabetes-clinical-dataset/code

The dataset comprises health and demographic data of 100,000 individuals, including:

- Demographic information (age, gender, race)
- Health metrics (BMI, blood glucose level, HbA1c)
- Medical history (hypertension, heart disease)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking history)

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Addressing the imbalanced nature of diabetes diagnoses in the dataset
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identifying and managing outliers in key health metrics

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit_learn
- Streamlit

## The Project Overview

- Implemented machine learning models for diabetes prediction.
- Evaluated and compared different model performances.
- Developed a user-friendly interface for diabetes classification and prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Diabetes_Diagnosis_Project.ipynb`
3. Run the Deployed Model Using Streamlit: `streamlit run diabetes_app.py`
